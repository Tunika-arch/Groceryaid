        Wear your flaming hot OILy dress/suit(feel the heat on your skin), 
        wear your giganic TOMATO earring(or tie). Ouch! You need to feed your 3 chubby chicks -EGGS,
        sitted in the dinning room already.
        Can't believe it's RICEing. Oops! I mean raining again(literally see RICE falling from the sky).<br>
        Finally, the rain stopped but there is this CHEESE waving at you out the window, smiling from ear to ear at you.
        .He's creepy and he's coming closer.You can't go yet!!! What if he'll kidnap me (cheese). You need to grab my very long VINEGAR gun. it sure will make him sour.
        Poof!!! it so SUGARy. OOps! dusty. You haven't used the gun in a while or ever and the SUGAR(dust) is all over your face(taste it).<br>
